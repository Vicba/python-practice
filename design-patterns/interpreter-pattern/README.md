# Interpreter Pattern

1. What is it?

   The Interpreter Pattern is a design pattern in Python that helps us create a language interpreter. Think of it like a translator - it helps one part of your program understand and act upon commands or expressions given in a certain language.

1. What is its purpose?

   Its main purpose is to interpret and execute sentences in a language. Imagine you have a robot, and you want to teach it commands. The interpreter pattern helps you create a system that understands and follows those commands.

1. When to use this?

   Use the Interpreter Pattern when you have a language or set of commands that need to be interpreted and executed. For example, if you're making a game and you want to have a scripting language for character behavior, the interpreter pattern could be handy.

1. Small Code Example

```python
# Let's create a simple interpreter to add numbers

class AddInterpreter:
    def interpret(self, context):
        # Assuming context is a string with the format "add 3 and 4"
        parts = context.split(' ')
        if len(parts) == 3 and parts[0] == 'add' and parts[2] == 'and':
            result = int(parts[1]) + int(parts[3])
            return result
        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid command format")

# Example of usage
interpreter = AddInterpreter()
result = interpreter.interpret("add 3 and 4")
print(result)  # Output: 7

```

In this example, our interpreter understands the command "add 3 and 4" and gives the result 7. It's a simple language interpreter!
